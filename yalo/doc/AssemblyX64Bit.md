There are 4 bit instructions which have similar formats of
instructions. They are discussed together here.

The instructions are:
* bt:  bit test
* btc: bit test and complement
* btr: bit test and reset
* bts: bit test and set

The format of the instructions are given below.

| Instruction    | Opcode                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| ins r/m16 r16  | 0F (+ base A3) /r       |
| ins r/m32 r32  | 0F (+ base A3) /r       |
| ins r/m32 r32  | 0F (+ base A3) /r       |
| ins r/m16 imm8 | 0F BA opcode ib         |
| ins r/m32 imm8 | 0F BA opcode ib         |
| ins r/m64 imm8 | REX.W 0F BA opcode ib   |

Base and opcode in above table are given below for each instruction.

| Instruction | Base (hexadecimal) | Opcode |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| bt          | 0                  | /4     |
| btc         | 18                 | /7     |
| btr         | 10                 | /6     |
| bts         | 8                  | /5     |
