==== INFORMATION ===

This is the first official release for public distribution. Presently,
only media for the LMI Lambda is provided. A source repository browsable
from PCs will be available soon.

The distribution has most systems precompiled.Â Systems which are not
precompiled should be compiled using the form
(MAKE-SYSTEM 'FOO :COMPILE :DEFAULTED-BATCH :NO-INCREMENT-PATCH)
where FOO is the name of the system to be loaded. All systems in
SYSTEM, OUTER-SYSTEM, and OPTIONAL-SYSTEM have been precompiled.

Disregard warnings about unimplemented/missing UEFI-PC conditionals.
UEFI-PC is a placeholder in this release and is not yet implemented.

==== INSTALLATION ====

The installation media consists of two tapes.
The first contains the installation software, microcode, and load band.
The second is a regular backup to be restored using the backup activity.
